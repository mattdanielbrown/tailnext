| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework    | Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) with React 19                                      |
| Styling      | Tailwind CSS 4, CSS-first `@theme` configuration                                      |
| Language     | TypeScript 6, strict mode                                                             |
| Content      | MDX through content-collections, frontmatter validated with Zod                       |
| Highlighting | Shiki at build time, light and dark themes                                            |
| Testing      | Every Storybook story runs as a browser test in Vitest, with axe accessibility checks |
| Tooling      | ESLint 9 flat config, Prettier, husky, lint-staged, commitlint                        |

Dark mode, SEO metadata, Open Graph images, JSON-LD, a native sitemap and
security headers are wired up rather than left as exercises.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arthelokyo/tailnext.git
cd tailnext
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>.

Node 24 is the target. `.nvmrc` pins it, and `engines` sets the floor at 20.9.

```

## Configuration

Site-wide settings live in `src/config.ts`. The canonical origin can be
overridden per environment with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN`, which is useful for
preview deployments and forks; see `.env.example`.

Design tokens are defined in `src/assets/styles/base.css` under `@theme`.
Tailwind 4 has no `tailwind.config.js`.

## Writing content

Add an `.mdx` file to `src/content/blog`:

```mdx
---
title: 'Post title'
description: 'Shown in search results and social cards'
publishDate: 'Nov 02 2022'
image: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...'
tags: [markdown, blog]
---

Your content. Code blocks are highlighted by Shiki.
```

Frontmatter is validated at build time. A missing title or an unparseable
`publishDate` fails the build with a specific message instead of rendering
something wrong.

Set `draft: true` to keep a post out of the site.

## Testing

There is no separate test directory. Stories are the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Each story renders in headless Chromium and is checked with axe. An
accessibility violation fails the run, so regressions surface before review.

## Deploy

The build is a standard Next.js application and runs anywhere Next.js does.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Farthelokyo%2Ftailnext)
[![Netlify Deploy button](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/arthelokyo/tailnext.git)

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN` to the deployed domain so canonical URLs, the
sitemap and social cards point at the right place.
